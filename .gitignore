# file.c for a file
# *.c for all .c files
# dir/ for directories
# /file, /dir/, dir/file for files and dirs relative to the current .gitignore
# !file to exlude file from .gitignore if it was covered by other pattern
# [a-zA-Z], * and ? are self-explanatory.
# **/file match in all directories
# dir/** match everything inside
# dir/**/file match everything that is dir/something/file
# the dir/* thing only covers files on that level, meaning that dir/something/file will still be covered. Not with dir/**, tho.
