# C++ tutorial & Git learning minefield
This repository contains small projects I've been making for a tutorial at https://vermishelb.neocities.org/ru/cpp/.  
Contents:
* `Notes.md` — various notes I leave as I do something here. Has some stuff about Git, CMake and other things.
* `tutorial-from-neocities` — all projects related to the abovementioned tutorial.
* `base` — a template-like project with a little bit of everything.
